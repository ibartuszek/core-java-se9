/**
 * Implement an immutable class Point that describes a point in the plane.
 * Provide a constructor to set it to a specific point, a no-arg constructor to set it
 * to the origin, and methods getX, getY, translate, and scale. The
 * translate method moves the point by a given amount in x- and y-direction.
 * The scale method scales both coordinates by a given factor. Implement
 * these methods so that they return new points with the results. For example,
 * Point p = new Point(3, 4).translate(1, 3).scale(0.5);
 * should set p to a point with coordinates (2, 3.5).
